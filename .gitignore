1️⃣ Set Up an AWS EC2 Instance (Virtual Server)
Step 1: Create an EC2 Instance
Go to AWS EC2 and log in.

Click "Launch Instance".

Choose Ubuntu 22.04 as the OS.

Choose t2.micro (Free Tier eligible).

Create a new key pair and download the .pem file (you’ll need this for SSH access).

Configure security groups:

Allow HTTP (port 80) and HTTPS (port 443) for web access.

Allow port 5000 if you plan to run Flask directly.

Allow SSH (port 22) to connect to the server.

Click Launch and wait for the instance to start.
